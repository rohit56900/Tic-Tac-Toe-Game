# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Description of the Game Project:
Here I am taking the example of Tic Tac Toe game. I have implemented minimax algorithms with the help of C++ programming language to make it. In this game there are two players one is HUMAN and another one is COMPUTER. There are two filling options in 3X3 grid board with sign of X and O. In this game if HUMAN wants to start or either they can give the opportunity to COMPUTER to start the game. When game will start the first one will move own step and the second opponent will also decide the best move. If component's move fills all the empty boxes like Vertically, Horizontally or Diagonally. Then that the player will be the winner and the opponent will be the looser, if it doesn't satisfy the condition then the game will be draw. As you can see the output below:
